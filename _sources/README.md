[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/COMPAS-Surrogate/lnl_surrogate/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/COMPAS-Surrogate/lnl_surrogate?branch=main)

This python package helps make an LnL surrogate for COMPAS SF-params given a set of BBH mergers.
The surrogate is trained using active learning/bayesian optimisation techniques.
This package acts as a bridge between the COMPAS [LnL computer](https://github.com/COMPAS-Surrogate/lnl_computer), surrogate modelling packages, and Bayesian optimisation packages.
